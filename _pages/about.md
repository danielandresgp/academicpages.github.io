## Welcome!

I live in beautiful South Florida, where I work as Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) at the University of Miami. I am happily married to [Lis](https://www.instagram.com/lisettesarrias/). She is much more than I could ever deserve! We have a beautiful boy called Juan Pablo, our [mustard seed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mateo+13%3A31-32&version=NIV). The most significant aspect of my life is that I love Jesus, but not as much as [He loves me](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV)! If you are interested, we can talk about it!

Besides research, my hobbies are spending time with my family, working out, reading, and writing.
