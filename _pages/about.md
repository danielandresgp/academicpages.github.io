## Welcome!

<p align="justify">I live in beautiful South Florida, where I am an Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) at the University of Miami. My research primarily focuses on probability and information theory, and I have also recently developed an interest in mathematical statistics. You can learn more about it <a href="https://danielandresgp.github.io/research/">here</a>.</p>

<p align="justify">I am happily married to <a href="https://www.instagram.com/lisettesarrias/">Lis</a>. She is much more than I could ever deserve. We have a beautiful boy called Juan Pablo, our <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mateo+13%3A31-32&version=NIV">mustard seed</a>. Besides research, my hobbies are spending time with my family, working out, reading, and writing. The most significant aspect of my life is that I love Jesus, but not as much as <a href="https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV">He loves me!</a> If you are interested, we can talk about it!</p>
