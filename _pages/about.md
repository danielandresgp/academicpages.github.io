I am a probabilist working as Research Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) at the University of Miami, where I was also a Postdoctoral Associate. 

Theoretically, my current research can be divided into two areas: First, **information theory**, applied to statistics and machine learning. Second, more recently I became very interested **high-dimensional probability**, as a mathematical foundation for data science and statistical learning.

I have applied my research to the following areas:

1. **Population genetics**: Measuring the effect of "forces" like mutations and selection in non-neutral models, relative to neutral ones.
2. **Infectious diseases**: Correcting estimators of prevalence, inspired by Covid-19 mostly.
3. **Bump hunting**: Finding maxima in machine learning settings, both supervised and unsupervised.
4. **Fine tuning**: Determining probabilities for life to exist, from local cnditions to cosmological ones. 


I love Jesus, but not as much as [He loves me](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV). If you are interested, we can talk about it!
