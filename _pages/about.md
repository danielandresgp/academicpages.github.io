I am Research Assistant Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Miami. I received my PhD in Probability at the Institute of Mathematics and Statistics at the University of São Paulo, and my B.S. in Statistics at National University of Colombia. 

Research interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection, or maybe the union, of the following areas:

• Probability

• Statistics 

• Machine learning

• Information theory

• Philosophy of science
