I am  Assistant Professor at the University of Miami in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) , where I was also a Postdoctoral Associate. I received my PhD in Probability at the [_Instituto de Matemática e Estatística_](https://www.ime.usp.br/en/home/) from _Universidade de São Paulo_, Brazil, and my B.S. in [Statistics](http://ciencias.bogota.unal.edu.co/departamentos/departamento-de-estadistica/inicio/) from _Universidad Nacional de Colombia_, with minors in Mathematics and Biostatistics. 

My research started as an undergraduate student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia on [strip-split-plot experimental designs](https://biometria.ufla.br/index.php/BBJ/article/view/141), for which I received my first NSF travel award. This led me to University of São Paulo, Brazil, where, under the direction of [Serguei Popov](https://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/serguei.popov/), I worked on [continuous percolation](https://doi.org/10.1080/17442508.2011.651215) and [large deviations](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10959-010-0304-9) for a model called Stable Marriage of Poisson and Lebesgue. Two years after, I came to the Division of Biostatistics of the University of Miami (UM), where I was introduced to machine learning and high-dimensional statistics through [bump hunting algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41573-4_16). After this point, my research became an eclectic mix of probability, information theory, machine learning and statistics, applied to areas as diverse as philosophy, psychology, cosmology, biology, and public health.

The most significant aspect of my life is that I am a follower of Jesus. If you are interested, we can talk about it.
