## Welcome!

I live in beautiful South Florida, where I work as Research Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) at the University of Miami. 

My current research revolves around **probability** and **information theory**, with applications to machine learning, physics, statistics, and infectious disesaes, among others. I also have a penchant for the philosophy of science, which motivates a lot of my research. I have worked on the following areas:

1. **Fine-tuning**: Cosmological fine-tuning (FT) states that some constants of nature must pertain to intervals of minuscule probability in
order to permit the existence of carbon-based life. For each constant of nature $x_0$, the problem is twofold: first, finding its life-permitting interval (LPI) $A = x_0[1−\epsilon, 1+\epsilon]$ (a physics problem); second, assuming
that x0 is the realization of a random variable X, estimating the probability P0(X ∈ A) of the constant pertaining
to its LPI. However, the second step remained elusive for years, as estimating the probability of the LPI required
using a sample of size 1 (the value of the constant in our uni-verse), taken from an unknown distribution P0,
supported in an unknown sample space S, where the sample is affected by selection bias because it corresponds
to a universe that permits life.
2. **Infectious diseases**: Correcting estimators of prevalence, inspired by Covid-19 mostly.
3. **Bump hunting**: Finding maxima for supervised and unsupervised. machine learning.
4. **Fine tuning**: . 

A more detailed description of these items can be found in the Research tab.

Besides research, my hobbies are crossfit, reading, and writing.

I am happily married to Lis. She is much more than I could ever deserve! We have a beautiful baby boy called Juan Pablo, our [mustard seed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mateo+13%3A31-32&version=NIV).

The most significant aspect of my life is that I love Jesus, but not as much as [He loves me](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV)! If you are interested, we can talk about it!
