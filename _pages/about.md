I am Research Assistant Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Miami, where I was also a Postdoctoral Associate. I received my PhD in Probability at the _Instituto de Matemática e Estatística_ from _Universidade de São Paulo_, Brazil, and my B.S. in Statistics from _Universidad Nacional de Colombia_, with "minors" in Mathematics and Biostatistics. 

My prime research driver is curiosity. I explore the role of information in complex systems, using probability, statistics, and machine learning, with a great deal of inspiration from philosophy. This amalgamation is the result of digging in different fields throughout my career.
