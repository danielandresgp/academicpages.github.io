## Welcome!

I live in beautiful South Florida, where I work as Research Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) at the University of Miami. 

Theoretically, my current research can be divided into two areas: First, **information theory**, as applied to statistics and machine learning. Second, more recently I became very interested in **high-dimensional probability**, as the mathematical foundation for data science and statistical learning.

I have applied my research to the following areas:

1. **Population genetics**: Measuring the effect of "forces" like selection and mutations in non-neutral models, relative to neutral ones.
2. **Infectious diseases**: Correcting estimators of prevalence, inspired by Covid-19 mostly.
3. **Bump hunting**: Finding maxima for supervised and unsupervised. machine learning.
4. **Fine tuning**: Determining probabilities for life to exist, from planetary conditions to cosmological ones. 

A more detailed description of these items can be found in the Research tab.

Besides research, my hobbies are crossfit, reading, and writing.

I am happily married to Lis. She is much more than I could ever deserve! We have a beautiful baby boy called Juan Pablo, our [mustard seed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mateo+13%3A31-32&version=NIV).

The most significant aspect of my life is that I love Jesus, but not as much as [He loves me](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV)! If you are interested, we can talk about it!
