I am Research Assistant Professor at the University of Miami in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) , where I was also a Postdoctoral Associate. I received my PhD in Probability at the [_Instituto de Matemática e Estatística_](https://www.ime.usp.br/en/home/) from _Universidade de São Paulo_, Brazil, and my B.S. in [Statistics](http://ciencias.bogota.unal.edu.co/departamentos/departamento-de-estadistica/inicio/) from _Universidad Nacional de Colombia_, with minors in Mathematics and Biostatistics. 

My research started as an undergraduate student at Universidad Nacional de Colombia on [strip-split-plot experimental designs](https://biometria.ufla.br/index.php/BBJ/article/view/141), under the direction of [Francisco Zimmermann](https://independent.academia.edu/FranciscoZimmermann) and Luis Alberto López. This led me to University of São Paulo, Brazil, where, under the direction of [Serguei Popov](https://www.fc.up.pt/pessoas/serguei.popov/), I worked on [continuous percolation](https://doi.org/10.1080/17442508.2011.651215) and [large deviations](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10959-010-0304-9) for a model called Stable Marriage of Poisson and Lebesgue. Two years after, I came to the Division of Biostatistics of the University of Miami (UM), where, mentored by [Sunil Rao](https://www.jsunilrao.com/), I worked on [bump hunting algorithms](https://doi.org/10.1007/978-3-319-41573-4_16). After this point, my theoretical research became an eclectic mix of probability, information theory, machine learning and statistics; and I have applied it to biology, public health, cosmology, and philosophy, among others.

The most significant aspect of my life is that I am a follower of Jesus. If you are interested, we can talk about it.
