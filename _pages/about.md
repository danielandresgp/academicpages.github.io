## Welcome!

I live in beautiful South Florida, where I work as Research Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics and Bioinformatics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) at the University of Miami. 

My current research revolves around **probability** and **information theory**, with applications to machine learning, physics, statistics, and infectious disesaes, among others. I also have a penchant for the philosophy of science, which motivates a lot of my research. I have worked on the following areas:

1. **Fine-tuning**: Cosmological fine-tuning (FT) states that some constants of nature must pertain to intervals of minuscule probability in
order to permit the existence of carbon-based life. The problem is twofold for each constant of nature: First, finding the constant's life permitting interval (LPI)---the set of possible values of the constant that would permit life (a physics problem); second, finding the probability that the constant of nature pertains to its LPI (a mathematical problem). When this probability is small, there is fine-tuning. However, the second step remained elusive for 50 years, as estimating the probability of the LPI required using a sample of size 1 (the value of the constant in our _uni_-verse), taken from an unknown distribution, supported in an unknown sample space, where the sample is affected by selection bias because it corresponds to a universe that permits life. My colleagues and I developed a sound solution to this problem through a Bayesian approach that relies on maximum entropy and optimization. A nice presentation on this topic can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_ZrLrrSTTE).
2. **Stable allocations**: Imagine you have a set of points $Z$ in some Euclidean space (formally, let $Z \subset \mathbb R^d$ be a Poisson process of intensity $\lambda$). Assume that every point in $Z$ desires for itself a territory of constant volume $V \subset \mathbb R^d$, which is as close to it as possible. To acquire their territory, all points grow around them a ball that increases at the same radial speed in such a way that (a) each point claims for itself all territory that any other point has not claimed, and (b) each point stops growing its ball only when it has claimed for itself a territory of volume $V$ . This informal presentation describes the stable marriage of Poisson and Lebesgue, a stochastic process that generalizes to continuous spaces the famous Gale-Shapley algorithm for which Lloyd Shapley received the Nobel Prize in 2012. I have worked with the stable marriage of Poisson and Lebesgue, randomizing the volume that each center desires, studying percolation and large deviations properties for this process.

4. **Bump hunting**: Finding maxima for supervised and unsupervised. machine learning.
5. **Fine tuning**: .

Besides research, my hobbies are crossfit, reading, and writing.

I am happily married to Lis. She is much more than I could ever deserve! We have a beautiful baby boy called Juan Pablo, our [mustard seed](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Mateo+13%3A31-32&version=NIV).

The most significant aspect of my life is that I love Jesus, but not as much as [He loves me](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John%203%3A16&version=NIV)! If you are interested, we can talk about it!
