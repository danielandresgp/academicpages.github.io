I am Research Assistant Professor in the Division of Biostatistics at the University of Miami, where I was also a Postdoctoral Associate. I received my PhD in Probability at the _Instituto de Matemática e Estatística_ from _Universidade de São Paulo_, Brazil, and my B.S. from _Universidad Nacional de Colombia_. 

My research interests lie at the intersection, or maybe the union, of the following areas:

* Probability

* Statistics 

* Machine learning

* Information theory

* Philosophy of science
