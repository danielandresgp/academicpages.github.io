I am Research Assistant Professor in the [Division of Biostatistics](https://www.publichealth.med.miami.edu/divisions/biostatistics/) at the [University of Miami](https://miami.edu/). I received my PhD in Probability at the [Instituto de Matemática e Estatística](https://www.ime.usp.br/) at [Universidade de São Paulo](https://www5.usp.br/), and my B.S. in Statistics at [Universidad Nacional de Colombia](https://unal.edu.co/). 

Research interests
======
My research interests lie at the intersection, or maybe the union, of the following areas:

• Probability

• Statistics 

• Machine learning

• Information theory

• Philosophy of science
