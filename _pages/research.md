<p align="justify">My research revolves around <b>probability</b>, <b>information theory</b>, and <b>mathematical statistics</b>. I have applied these tools to cosmology, machine learning, origin of life, population genetics, and infectious diseases. I also have a penchant for the philosophy of science, which motivates a lot of my research. </p>

   <p align="justify">I have studied <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0909.5325">percolation</a> and <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/0911.1429">large deviations</a> properties of stable allocations to Poisson points. To get an intuition, imagine that you have a set of random points, or "centers", in the space. Assume that every center wants to colonize a random amount of territory which is as close to it as possible. To acquire territory, all centers grow around them a ball that increases its size at the same speed in such a way that (a) each center colonizes all the territory in the ball that was not previously colonized by any other center, and (b) each center stops growing its ball only when it has colonized the amount of territory it wanted to have. This stochastic process generalizes to continuous spaces the famous <a href="https://www.eecs.harvard.edu/cs286r/courses/fall09/papers/galeshapley.pdf">Galeâ€”Shapley algorithm</a> for which Lloyd Shapley received the Nobel Prize in 2012.</p>

      <p align="justify">The left-hand side shows the KL divergence of two probability measures $\mathbf P$ and $\mathbf P_0$ on the space $\Omega = \{\omega_1, \omega_2\}$, where the baseline $\mathbf P_0$ is in maximum entropy (i.e., $q := \mathbf P_0(\omega_1) = \mathbf P_0(\omega_2) = 0.5$) and $\mathbf P$ varies (with $p:=\mathbf P(\omega_1)$). The right-hand side considers the same probability measures for the total active information $\mathbf I^+ :=  \log[\mathbf P(\omega_1)/\mathbf P_0(\omega_1)] + \log[\mathbf P(\omega_2)/\mathbf P_0(\omega_2)]$. Observe that the KL divergence is only zero when $p=q$; anywhere else, it is positive. Instead, the total active information can be negative.</p>

<p align="justify">Shannon's information theory is almost exclusively focused on global averaged measures of information (entropy, mutual information, KL divergence, etc.) This approach overlooks the significance of local information measures the self-information of specific events. Paradoxically, since averages are by definition a reduction of information, information theory is constantly losing information. Consider, for instance, the active information (AIN)
\begin{equation*}
  I^+(\mathsf A) := \log \frac{\mathbf P(\mathsf A)}{\mathbf P_0(\mathsf A)},
\end{equation*}
where $\mathbf P$ and $\mathbf P_0$ are probability measures on a measurable space $(\Omega, \mathcal F)$ and $\mathsf A \subset \mathcal F$. In words, $I^+(\mathsf A)$ measures how  much information is added/removed from the event $\mathsf A$ when is measured with $\mathbf P$, instead of the baseline $\mathbf P_0$. In more detail, $I^+(\mathsf A)$ will be positive/negative/zero, when $\mathbf P(\mathsf A)$ is bigger/smaller/equal to $\mathbf P_0$, respectively. By contrast, the Kullback-Leibler divergence, the famous average of the active information,
   \begin{equation*}
      \mathrm{KL}(\mathbf P \mid \mathbf P_0) := \sum_{\omega \in \Omega} \mathbf P(\omega) \log \left(\frac{\mathbf P(\omega)}{\mathbf P_0(\\omega)}\right),
   \end{equation*}
is a nonnegative global average that can only be zero when $\mathbf P = \mathbf P_0$ with probability 1. Most of what follows shows that these differences between $I^+(\mathsf A)$ and $\mathrm{KL}(\mathbf P \mid \mathbf P_0)$ matter, and that progress has been hindered in many areas by ignoring local measures of information.</p>


   
## Fine-tuning

<p align="justify">Cosmological fine-tuning (FT) states that some constants of nature must pertain to intervals of minuscule probability in
order to permit the existence of carbon-based life. The problem is twofold for each constant of nature: First, finding the constant's life permitting interval (LPI)---the set of possible values of the constant that would permit life (a physics problem); second, finding the probability that the constant of nature pertains to its LPI (a mathematical problem). When this probability is small, there is fine-tuning. However, the second step remained elusive for 50 years, as estimating the probability of the LPI required using a sample of size 1 (the value of the constant in our _uni_-verse), taken from an unknown distribution, supported in an unknown sample space, where the sample is affected by selection bias because it corresponds to a universe that permits life. My colleagues and I developed a sound solution to this problem through a Bayesian approach that relies on maximum entropy and optimization (a nice presentation can be watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_ZrLrrSTTE">here</a>). I am now interested in estimating the probabilities of LPIs for more local conditions (as oposed to the universal ones determined by the constants of nature), like gallactic, planetary, and biological ones.</p>

## COVID-19

<p align="justify">During the COVID-19 pandemic, understanding the true prevalence of the virus was critical, but biased sampling hindered accurate estimations. Specifically, I realized that symptomatic individuals were more likely to seek testing. This bias led to overestimation of prevalence in first-world countries... and their subsequent adoption of horrible public health policies! Using the maximum entropy principle, my colleagues and I introduced corrected estimators as readily implementable algorithms directed to practitioners, while providing theoretical guarantees for our corrections. Among others, I am now interested in implementing these developments to artificial intelligence, where biases of algorithms are a huge ethical problem.</p>

## Clustering

<p align="justify">Since my days as a postdoc, I started working on machine learning problems related to bump-hunting. A unified definition of a cluster (or bump) is elusive. Nonetheless, it is clear that if $\mathsf S$ is bounded, it will not contain clusters when the data is uniformly distributed. For $\mathbf P$ and $\mathbf P_0$ the empirical and uniform distributions over $\mathsf S$, this is equivalent to saying that there is a cluster in $\mathsf A \subset \mathsf S$ if the active information $I^+(\mathsf A) > 0$, or in $\mathsf A^c$ if $I^+(\mathsf A) < 0$ (importantly, by contrast, the KL divergence, an averaged global measure, can only detect the existence of a cluster in $\mathsf S$ but not its location). Accordingly, in my first approach I have developed algorithms using $I^+(\mathsf A)$ as a test statistic for cluster detection in different regions of $\mathsf S$, offering guarantees for these algorithms. My second approach uses spectral algorithms for the detection of clusters... with a twist: I realized that as the leading eigenvectors correspond to larger variances, then data must be more clustered in the dimensions corresponding to the eigenvectors with the smallest eigenvalues.</p>
